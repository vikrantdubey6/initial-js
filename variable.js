// var is not preferred in modern JavaScript, use let or const instead because of issues in block scope and fuctional scope. lorem is not hoisted in the same way as var, and it can lead to unexpected behavior in loops and conditionals.



// typeof null returns "object"
//  whereas undefined returns "undefined".
//  NaN means not as number, it is being returned when a valuse is not a number.
